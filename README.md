# thumper

Thumper: One of the types of stills used to accomplish the second distillation of American whiskey. It effectively removes impurities and concentrates the alcohol even further. “Low wines” go in; “high wines” come out. Thumpers differ from doublers in that the low wines enter a thumper as vapors that are bubbled through water, causing the stills to make a thumping sound; a doubler makes no distinctive noise since the low wines enter in condensed, liquid form.


## Under Construction. Thumper is not at all ready for use.

To test and develop, first install Miniconda and clone this repo to your system. Then install an editable version of thumper.

```
cd thumper
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate thumper-env
pip install -e "."
```

## Run a demo

```
thumper run demo/demo.yaml
```
