# thumper

Thumper: One of the types of stills used to accomplish the second distillation of American whiskey. It effectively removes impurities and concentrates the alcohol even further. “Low wines” go in; “high wines” come out. Thumpers differ from doublers in that the low wines enter a thumper as vapors that are bubbled through water, causing the stills to make a thumping sound; a doubler makes no distinctive noise since the low wines enter in condensed, liquid form.


## Under Construction. We hope to have a v0.1 release soon.

To test and develop, first install Miniconda and clone this repo to your system. Then install an editable version of thumper.

```
git clone https://github.com/bluegenes/thumper.git
cd thumper
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate thumper
pip install -e "."
```

## Run a demo

```
thumper run demo/demo.yaml
```
